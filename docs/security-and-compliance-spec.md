## 1. Executive Summary

Kill the Clipboard is a web-based tool that enables healthcare organizations to receive patient health records by scanning SMART Health Link (SHL) QR codes. It was developed in support of the CMS Kill the Clipboard initiative, which promotes digital health data exchange between patients and providers.

**Key security properties:**

- **PHI never reaches the server.** All health data decryption and processing happens in the user's browser. The server functions as a CORS proxy for encrypted payloads and a routing layer for delivery — it never sees, processes, or stores decrypted patient data.
- **End-to-end encryption of health data.** SMART Health Links use AES-256-GCM encryption. Data remains encrypted from the SHL server all the way to the browser. The decryption key never leaves the browser.
- **Server handles routing, not processing.** After the browser decrypts health data, it sends it to the server solely for delivery to the organization's configured storage destination (Drive, OneDrive, Box, email, or API). This preserves admin-controlled routing while keeping PHI out of the server during the cryptographic processing phase.
- **Multi-tenant isolation.** Each healthcare organization operates under its own URL, credentials, and configuration. No data is shared between organizations.
- **Defense-in-depth against XSS.** All external data (SHL labels, FHIR fields, filenames) is HTML-sanitized before rendering. Content Security Policy headers restrict script execution and data exfiltration. CDN scripts are verified via Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes.
- **Server-side audit logging.** Every scan/route operation is logged with non-PHI metadata (timestamp, org, storage destination, record counts, success/failure). No patient data is written to the audit log.
- **Standards-based.** Built on SMART Health Links, FHIR R4, and SMART Health Cards — the same interoperability standards mandated by ONC and adopted by major EHR vendors and health apps.

## 2. System Overview

### What It Does

1. A patient presents a SMART Health Link QR code from their health app (e.g., Apple Health, Epic MyChart, or any of the 83 CMS-approved apps).
2. A front-desk staff member scans the QR code using the organization's Kill the Clipboard scanner page on a tablet or computer.
3. The system decodes the SMART Health Link, retrieves and decrypts the patient's FHIR health data and/or PDF documents.
4. The extracted data is routed to the organization's configured destination (Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, email, or API endpoint).

### What It Does NOT Do

- Does not create, modify, or store patient health records
- Does not function as an EHR or clinical system
- Does not retain health data after delivery to the configured destination
- Does not require patients to create accounts or share login credentials
- Does not access the patient's health app or device

### Design Principle: Threat Avoidance by Architecture

The system is designed to **structurally eliminate** threat categories rather than mitigate them:

- The server cannot leak decrypted PHI because it never performs decryption
- The CORS proxy cannot be used to exfiltrate health data because it only handles encrypted blobs — the decryption key never leaves the browser
- A server compromise yields organization configuration data, not patient records
- SSRF protection on the CORS proxy prevents requests to internal/private networks

## 4. Data Flow

### QR Code Scan → Data Delivery

```
Step 1: QR Scan (Client-side)
  Browser camera captures QR code image
  jsqr library decodes QR code locally in the browser

Step 2: SHL Parsing (Client-side)
  Parse SHL URI → extract manifest URL + AES-256 encryption key
  Key NEVER leaves the browser

Step 3: Manifest Fetch (Client → Server CORS Proxy → SHL Server)
  Browser sends manifest URL to server's CORS proxy
  Server fetches encrypted manifest from SHL server
  Server returns encrypted response verbatim to browser
  Server never sees the decryption key or decrypted content

Step 4: Decryption & Extraction (Client-side)
  Browser decrypts JWE payload using AES-256-GCM (jose library)
  Browser decompresses if DEFLATE-compressed (pako library)
  Browser parses FHIR Bundle(s) and/or extracts PDF documents
  All cryptographic operations happen in browser memory

Step 5: Data Routing (Client → Server → Storage Destination)
  Browser sends decrypted data to server's route endpoint
  Server routes to organization's configured destination:
  • Cloud storage: Upload via OAuth 2.0 API (Drive/OneDrive/Box)
  • Email: Send as attachment via OAuth 2.0 API (Gmail/Outlook)
  • API/Webhook: POST JSON payload to configured endpoint
  • Direct download: Returned to browser as file download

Step 6: Cleanup
  Browser releases health data references
  Server routing endpoint does not persist any health data
```

### Data Flow Diagram — What Touches What

| Data Element | Browser | Server (CORS Proxy) | Server (Route Endpoint) | Server Disk/DB | Destination |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| QR code image | ✅ Captured | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| SHL URI / key | ✅ Decoded | ❌ Never | ❌ Never | ❌ | ❌ |
| Encrypted JWE | ✅ Received | ✅ Pass-through | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Decrypted FHIR data | ✅ Decrypted | ❌ Never | ✅ Transient routing | ❌ | ✅ Delivered |
| Decrypted PDFs | ✅ Decrypted | ❌ Never | ✅ Transient routing | ❌ | ✅ Delivered |
| Org configuration | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ Persisted | ❌ |
| OAuth tokens | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ Persisted | ❌ |
| Password hashes | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ Persisted | ❌ |

**Key distinction:** The CORS proxy only handles encrypted blobs — it cannot access, read, or log the health data because it never has the decryption key. The route endpoint receives already-decrypted data solely for delivery purposes and does not persist it.

---

## 5. Data Classification & Handling

### Data Categories

| Category | Examples | Classification | Storage | Retention |
|----------|---------|---------------|---------|-----------|
| Patient Health Data | FHIR Bundles, PDFs, demographics | **PHI** | In-memory only | Duration of HTTP request (~seconds) |
| SHL Encryption Keys | AES-256 key from QR code | **Sensitive Cryptographic Material** | In-memory only | Duration of HTTP request |
| Organization Credentials | Admin/staff password hashes | **Sensitive** | SQLite database | Until org deletion |
| OAuth Refresh Tokens | Google, Microsoft, Box tokens | **Sensitive** | SQLite database (encrypted with per-org AES-256-GCM key) | Until disconnected or org deletion |
| Organization Settings | Name, slug, storage config | **Internal** | SQLite database | Until org deletion |

### PHI Handling Principles

1. **Browser-side decryption:** All SHL decryption and FHIR parsing occurs in the user's browser. The decryption key never leaves the browser. The server's CORS proxy only transports encrypted JWE blobs.
2. **Server handles routing, not processing:** The server receives already-decrypted data from the browser solely for delivery to the configured storage destination. This data is transient in server memory (typically 1-3 seconds) and is not persisted.
3. **No logging of PHI:** Health data content is never written to application logs. Error messages reference processing stage, not data content.
4. **No indexing:** Patient records are not searchable, queryable, or browsable within the system.
5. **No caching:** Health data is not cached in any server-side or client-side persistent store (no Redis, no file cache, no session store, no localStorage).
6. **Structural threat elimination:** The architecture is designed so that a server compromise cannot expose the cryptographic processing of health data — because that processing doesn't happen on the server.

---

## 6. Authentication & Access Control

### Dual-Password Model

Each organization has two independent authentication levels:

| Role | Access | Default Timeout | Purpose |
|------|--------|----------------|---------|
| **Admin** | Organization settings, integrations, password management | 24 hours | IT administrator or office manager |
| **Staff** | QR code scanner only | Configurable (1h / 4h / 8h / 12h / 24h) | Front-desk or clinical staff |

### Password Security

- **Hashing algorithm:** bcrypt with cost factor 10
- **Salting:** Automatic per-hash salt (bcrypt standard)
- **Plaintext storage:** Never — only bcrypt hashes are stored
- **Password requirements:** Minimum 6 characters (configurable by organization)

### Session Token Architecture

- **Format:** Custom compact token: `base64url(payload).HMAC-SHA256(payload)`
- **Signing key:** `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable (cryptographically random, set at deployment)
- **Payload contents:** Organization slug, role (admin/staff), organization ID, expiration timestamp
- **Token delivery:** Returned to client as JSON; stored in browser `localStorage`; sent as `Authorization: Bearer` header
- **Expiration:** Enforced server-side on every request; tokens cannot be extended without re-authentication
- **No sensitive data in tokens:** Tokens contain only organizational identifiers, never patient data

### Route Protection

- All API endpoints require valid authentication tokens via Express middleware
- Admin endpoints require `role: admin` in the token
- Staff endpoints accept either `admin` or `staff` roles
- Token slug must match the requested organization's slug (cross-tenant access denied)
- Public endpoints (registration, login, static assets) do not require authentication

---

## 7. Encryption & Cryptography

### Data in Transit

| Connection | Protocol | Enforcement |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Browser ↔ Application Server | HTTPS (TLS 1.2+) | Enforced by Fly.io edge proxy; `force_https = true` |
| Application Server ↔ SHL Server | HTTPS | Standard Node.js `fetch` with TLS verification |
| Application Server ↔ Google APIs | HTTPS | Required by Google API client libraries |
| Application Server ↔ Microsoft Graph | HTTPS | Required by Microsoft API endpoints |
| Application Server ↔ Box API | HTTPS | Required by Box API endpoints |

### Data at Rest (Health Records)

Health records are **not stored at rest** on the server. They exist only transiently in server memory.

### Data at Rest (Configuration)

| Data | Protection |
|------|-----------|
| Passwords | bcrypt hashed (cost factor 10) |
| OAuth refresh tokens | Encrypted at rest with per-organization AES-256-GCM keys (derived from `HMAC-SHA256(SESSION_SECRET, orgId)`). Database also resides on encrypted Fly.io volume. |
| Session signing key | Environment variable, not stored in code or database |
| Database file | Resides on Fly.io persistent volume with filesystem-level access controls |

### Cryptographic Operations

| Operation | Algorithm | Library | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|---------|
| SHL payload decryption | AES-256-GCM (JWE) | jose | Decrypt patient health data |
| JWE key management | Direct (`dir`) | jose | Unwrap content encryption key |
| Password hashing | bcrypt (cost 10) | bcryptjs | Hash admin and staff passwords |
| Session token signing | HMAC-SHA256 | Node.js `crypto` | Sign/verify authentication tokens |
| OAuth token encryption | AES-256-GCM | Node.js `crypto` | Encrypt OAuth refresh tokens at rest with per-org derived keys |
| Per-org key derivation | HMAC-SHA256 | Node.js `crypto` | Derive per-organization encryption keys from SESSION_SECRET |
| SHC JWS decoding | Base64url + DEFLATE | Node.js `zlib` | Decode SMART Health Card payloads |

### Algorithm Restrictions

The JWE decryptor explicitly restricts accepted algorithms:
- Content encryption: `A256GCM` only
- Key management: `dir` (direct) only
- This prevents algorithm confusion/downgrade attacks

---

## 8. Network Security

### Inbound Traffic

- All HTTP traffic redirected to HTTPS (Fly.io `force_https`)
- TLS termination at Fly.io edge proxy
- Application listens on internal port 3000 (not directly exposed)
- No WebSocket connections
- No server-sent events

### Outbound Traffic

| Destination | Purpose | Protocol |
|-------------|---------|----------|
| SHL manifest servers (varies) | Fetch encrypted health data | HTTPS |
| accounts.google.com | OAuth 2.0 flows (Drive, Gmail) | HTTPS |
| login.microsoftonline.com | OAuth 2.0 flows (OneDrive, Outlook) | HTTPS |
| account.box.com | OAuth 2.0 flow (Box) | HTTPS |
| www.googleapis.com | Drive file upload, Gmail send | HTTPS |
| graph.microsoft.com | OneDrive upload, Outlook send | HTTPS |
| api.box.com | Box file upload | HTTPS |

### CORS Proxy Security

The server includes a CORS proxy endpoint that bridges browser requests to SHL manifest servers. This proxy has strict security controls:

- **SSRF protection:** Blocks requests to private/internal IP ranges (RFC 1918, RFC 4193), localhost, link-local, cloud metadata endpoints (169.254.169.254, metadata.google.internal), IPv6-mapped IPv4 addresses, and non-HTTP protocols
- **Redirect validation:** HTTP redirects are not auto-followed; each redirect target is validated against the SSRF blocklist before following, with a maximum of 3 redirects
- **Header allowlisting:** Only safe HTTP headers (`Content-Type`, `Accept`) are forwarded
- **Method restriction:** Only `GET` and `POST` methods are proxied
- **Rate limiting:** 30 requests per minute per IP address
- **Authentication required:** Staff or admin token required to use the proxy
- **Encrypted payloads only:** The proxy transports encrypted JWE blobs — the decryption key never leaves the browser, so the proxy cannot read the health data

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

HTTP security headers are set on all responses to mitigate XSS and injection attacks:

- `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://unpkg.com https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com https://cdn.jsdelivr.net` — scripts only from self and trusted CDNs
- `connect-src 'self'` — AJAX/fetch requests only to same origin (prevents data exfiltration)
- `object-src 'none'` — no plugin-based content (Flash, Java)
- `base-uri 'self'` — prevents base tag injection
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` — prevents MIME type sniffing
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` — prevents clickjacking
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` — limits referrer information

### Subresource Integrity (SRI)

All CDN-hosted scripts include `integrity` attributes with SHA-384 hashes and `crossorigin="anonymous"`. This ensures that if a CDN is compromised or a script is tampered with in transit, the browser will refuse to execute it. Covered libraries:

| Library | Version | Source |
|---------|---------|--------|
| html5-qrcode | 2.3.8 | unpkg.com |
| jose | 5.9.6 | cdnjs.cloudflare.com |
| pako | 2.1.0 | unpkg.com |
| qrcode | 1.4.4 | cdn.jsdelivr.net |

### XSS Prevention

All external data rendered via `innerHTML` is sanitized through an `escapeHtml()` function that escapes HTML special characters (`<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`). This prevents injection attacks from attacker-controlled content in:

- SHL `label` fields (the primary poisoned-QR attack vector)
- FHIR resource type names
- PDF filenames from DocumentReference attachments
- App identity names from verification QR codes
- Error messages from storage providers
- Storage labels and folder links

Download buttons use `data-*` attributes and event listeners instead of inline `onclick` handlers with interpolated filenames, preventing attribute injection.

Additional input validation:
- **Base64 validation (`isSafeBase64`):** Validates that base64 data contains only `[A-Za-z0-9+/=\s]` before embedding in `<embed src="data:...">` tags, preventing attribute breakout
- **URL protocol validation (`isSafeUrl`):** Validates `https:` protocol only before rendering URLs as `href` values, preventing `javascript:` and `data:` URI injection
- **Server-side HTML escaping:** OAuth callback error pages escape `err.message`, `orgSlug`, and `userEmail` via server-side `escapeHtml()` to prevent reflected XSS

### Browser Security

- Static HTML pages served for scanner, admin, registration
- API endpoints return JSON responses
- Server-side FHIR validation rejects malformed data before routing
- Browser camera access requires HTTPS (enforced by browser security model)

### Rate Limiting

Rate limiting protects against brute-force attacks and abuse using `express-rate-limit`:

| Endpoint | Limit | Window | Purpose |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| `/api/orgs/:slug/auth` | 20 attempts | 15 minutes | Prevents password brute-force (especially important given 4-character minimum for staff passwords) |
| `/api/orgs/:slug/shl-proxy` | 30 requests | 1 minute | Prevents proxy abuse |
| `/api/orgs` (registration) | 5 requests | 1 hour | Prevents registration spam |
| Super-admin endpoints | 20 attempts | 15 minutes | Protects admin API key |

Rate limit headers (`RateLimit-*`) are returned in responses per RFC 6585.

### OAuth CSRF Protection

OAuth state parameters are HMAC-signed to prevent cross-site request forgery:

1. **State generation:** `createSignedOAuthState(slug, orgId)` produces `{slug, orgId, sig}` where `sig = HMAC-SHA256(SESSION_SECRET, {slug, orgId})`
2. **State verification:** `verifyOAuthState(state)` validates the HMAC signature using timing-safe comparison before trusting the slug or orgId
3. **Impact:** Prevents an attacker from forging OAuth state to link their storage account to a victim's organization, which would cause PHI to be routed to the attacker's storage

### Timing-Safe Comparisons

All security-sensitive string comparisons use `crypto.timingSafeEqual()` to prevent timing side-channel attacks:

- Session token HMAC signature verification (`src/auth.js`)
- Super-admin API key verification (`server.js`)
- OAuth state HMAC signature verification (`server.js`)

### Audit Logging

Every scan/route operation is logged to an `audit_log` table with metadata only (no PHI):

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `org_slug` | Organization identifier |
| `event_type` | Type of event (e.g., `scan_route`) |
| `storage_type` | Destination (drive, onedrive, box, gmail, outlook, api, download) |
| `fhir_bundle_count` | Number of FHIR bundles processed |
| `pdf_count` | Number of PDFs processed |
| `success` | Whether the operation succeeded |
| `error_message` | Error details if failed |
| `ip_address` | Client IP address |
| `user_agent` | Client user agent string |
| `created_at` | Timestamp |

Audit logs are accessible via admin API endpoints and can be used for compliance reporting, incident investigation, and usage analytics.

## 9. Infrastructure & Deployment

### Hosting

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Platform | Fly.io (PaaS) |
| Region | `iad` (US-East, Ashburn, Virginia) |
| Instance type | Shared CPU, 1 GB RAM |
| Operating system | Debian (node:20-slim container) |
| Minimum instances | 1 (auto-scale) |
| HTTPS enforcement | Yes, at edge |
| Data residency | United States |

### Persistent Storage

- **Type:** Fly.io persistent volume (`ktc_data`)
- **Mount point:** `/data`
- **Contents:** SQLite database file (`ktc.db`)
- **Contains:** Organization configuration, password hashes, OAuth refresh tokens
- **Does NOT contain:** Patient health data, FHIR records, PDFs, or any PHI

### Container Security

- **Base image:** `node:20-slim` (minimal Debian variant)
- **Dependencies:** Production only (`npm ci --omit=dev`)
- **Build:** Deterministic from lockfile (`npm ci`)
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions deploys to Fly.io on push to `main` branch

### Self-Hosting / Single-Tenant Deployment

Kill the Clipboard can also be self-hosted as a single-tenant instance. The application is a single Node.js server with a SQLite database — no external infrastructure dependencies (no Redis, no PostgreSQL, no message queues). Organizations that want to eliminate multi-tenant risk entirely can deploy the same codebase on their own infrastructure (Docker, VM, or cloud instance) with a single organization configured. The self-hosted deployment uses the same security controls (token encryption, CSP headers, SSRF protection) as the hosted version.

### Environment Variables (Secrets)

All sensitive configuration is stored as Fly.io secrets (encrypted at rest, injected at runtime):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SESSION_SECRET` | HMAC key for session token signing and per-org OAuth token encryption key derivation |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth client identifier |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth client secret |
| `ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_ID` | Microsoft OAuth client identifier |
| `ONEDRIVE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Microsoft OAuth client secret |
| `BOX_CLIENT_ID` | Box OAuth client identifier |
| `BOX_CLIENT_SECRET` | Box OAuth client secret |
| `PUBLIC_URL` | Application public URL for OAuth callbacks |

---

## 10. Third-Party Integrations

### OAuth 2.0 Integrations

Each integration uses the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code flow with the minimum required scopes:

| Service | OAuth Provider | Scopes Requested | Data Access |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| Google Drive | Google | `drive.file` | Create files/folders in authorized folder only |
| Gmail | Google | `gmail.send` | Send email only — no read/modify/delete access |
| OneDrive | Microsoft | `Files.ReadWrite.All`, `offline_access` | Create files/folders |
| Outlook | Microsoft | `Mail.Send`, `offline_access` | Send email only — no read/modify/delete access |
| Box | Box | `root_readwrite` | Upload files to specified folder |

### Token Lifecycle

1. **Authorization:** Admin initiates OAuth flow from the admin settings page
2. **Token exchange:** Authorization code exchanged for access + refresh tokens
3. **Encryption:** Refresh token encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a key derived from `HMAC-SHA256(SESSION_SECRET, orgId)` — each organization gets a unique encryption key
4. **Storage:** Encrypted refresh token stored in SQLite database, scoped to the authorizing organization
5. **Usage:** Encrypted token decrypted in memory when needed; access tokens refreshed automatically when expired
6. **Revocation:** Admin can disconnect any service at any time, deleting the stored refresh token
7. **Isolation:** Each organization's tokens are independently encrypted; a database leak alone does not expose usable tokens

### Minimum Privilege Principle

- **Google Drive:** `drive.file` scope — can only access files created by the application, not the user's entire Drive
- **Gmail / Outlook:** Send-only permissions — the application cannot read, search, modify, or delete existing emails
- **All services:** OAuth tokens are scoped to the specific account that authorized them

---

## 11. App Validation & Anti-Spoofing

Kill the Clipboard includes an optional app validation feature that allows organizations to verify a patient's health app is on the CMS-approved list before scanning their health data QR code.

### Current Implementation (Phase 1)

- Organizations can enable a two-step scan flow: first scan an app identity QR code, then scan the health data QR code
- App identity is checked against a list of 83 CMS-approved apps
- This is a **UX verification step** — it demonstrates the workflow but does not provide cryptographic proof of app identity
- Per-organization toggle: each organization chooses whether to require this step

### Production Roadmap (Phase 3)

The architecture for cryptographic app attestation has been designed and documented:

- **JWS-signed attestation tokens** using ES256 (ECDSA with P-256/SHA-256)
- **Dynamic QR codes** with timestamps, nonces, and 5-minute expiration
- **Signature verification** against public keys published in the CMS National Provider Directory via JWKS endpoints
- **Anti-spoofing protections:** Token expiration, cryptographic signatures, nonce-based replay prevention
- **Key management:** CMS issues signing keys to approved apps; apps store private keys in platform secure enclaves (iOS Keychain, Android Keystore)

This aligns with the SMART Health Cards cryptographic model and NIST-approved algorithms.

## 12. HIPAA Alignment

### How Kill the Clipboard Supports HIPAA-Compliant Workflows

| HIPAA Requirement | How Kill the Clipboard Addresses It |
|---|---|
| **Minimum Necessary** | Only processes data contained in the patient-presented QR code; does not access any additional records |
| **Access Controls** | Dual-password authentication; role-based access (admin vs. staff); configurable session timeouts |
| **Encryption in Transit** | All connections use HTTPS/TLS |
| **Encryption at Rest** | Health data is not stored at rest; OAuth tokens encrypted at rest with per-org AES-256-GCM keys; database on encrypted infrastructure |
| **Audit Controls** | Each scan/route operation is logged to `audit_log` table with non-PHI metadata (timestamp, org, storage type, record counts, success/failure, IP, user agent). Admin and super-admin API endpoints for log review. OAuth token usage auditable via third-party provider logs. |
| **Integrity** | FHIR data validated for structural integrity; AES-256-GCM provides authenticated encryption (tamper detection) |
| **Automatic Logoff** | Configurable session timeouts (1h / 4h / 8h / 12h / 24h) |
| **Unique User Identification** | Organizations identified by unique slug; admin and staff roles separated |

### Shared Responsibility

Kill the Clipboard is designed as a **data routing tool**, not a data storage system. HIPAA compliance is a shared responsibility:

| Responsibility | Owner |
|---|---|
| Health data transient processing security | Kill the Clipboard |
| HTTPS enforcement and network security | Kill the Clipboard + Fly.io |
| Authentication and session management | Kill the Clipboard |
| Multi-tenant data isolation | Kill the Clipboard |
| Business Associate Agreement with cloud storage provider | Subscribing organization |
| Email account HIPAA compliance (e.g., Google Workspace HIPAA BAA) | Subscribing organization |
| Staff training on scanner use | Subscribing organization |
| Physical security of scanning devices | Subscribing organization |
| Destination system access controls | Subscribing organization |
| API endpoint security (for webhook destinations) | Subscribing organization |

### Business Associate Agreement (BAA) Considerations

- When organizations route data to **Google Workspace** accounts, they should have a Google Workspace BAA in place
- When organizations route data to **Microsoft 365** accounts, they should have a Microsoft BAA in place
- **Box** offers BAA-eligible plans for healthcare organizations
- For **API/webhook** destinations, the receiving system's HIPAA compliance is the organization's responsibility
- Kill the Clipboard's transient processing model minimizes the scope of BAA requirements for the service itself

## 15. Risk Assessment & Mitigations

| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|----------|-----------|------------|
| **PHI exposure via server compromise** | High | Very Low | PHI decryption occurs in the browser, not on the server. The server's CORS proxy only handles encrypted JWE blobs and never possesses the decryption key. The route endpoint receives decrypted data transiently for delivery only — a server compromise would require intercepting an active routing operation. |
| **OAuth token theft** | Medium | Very Low | Tokens encrypted at rest with per-organization AES-256-GCM keys derived from `HMAC-SHA256(SESSION_SECRET, orgId)`. A database leak alone does not expose usable tokens. Each token scoped to one organization. Revocable by admin at any time. |
| **Session token forgery** | Medium | Very Low | HMAC-SHA256 signed with cryptographically random secret. Token expiration enforced server-side. Timing-safe comparison prevents side-channel attacks. |
| **Password brute force** | Medium | Low | bcrypt with cost factor 10 makes brute force computationally expensive (~100ms per attempt). Rate limiting (20 attempts per 15 minutes per IP) prevents automated attacks. |
| **QR code spoofing (app identity)** | Low | Medium | Phase 1 uses static list (spoofable). Phase 3 roadmap adds cryptographic attestation with JWS signatures. |
| **SQL injection** | High | Very Low | All database queries use parameterized statements. Column names validated against allowlist. |
| **Cross-tenant data access** | High | Very Low | Token-based slug verification on every request. Staff tokens cannot access other organizations' data. |
| **Decompression bomb (zip bomb via JWE)** | Medium | Low | 5 MB maximum decompression limit enforced on all inflate operations. |
| **SSRF via malicious SHL URL** | Medium | Very Low | CORS proxy validates all URLs against SSRF blocklist (RFC 1918, RFC 4193, localhost, link-local, cloud metadata, IPv6-mapped addresses). Redirects validated before following (max 3). Rate limited to 30 requests/minute per IP. |
| **OAuth CSRF (storage hijack)** | High | Very Low | OAuth state parameters are HMAC-signed with `SESSION_SECRET`. Callback verifies signature using timing-safe comparison before trusting the state payload. Forged state is silently rejected. |
| **XSS via SHL content** | Medium | Very Low | All external data HTML-sanitized via `escapeHtml()` before `innerHTML` rendering. CSP restricts script sources. CDN scripts verified via SRI hashes. `connect-src 'self'` blocks data exfiltration. Poisoned QR code attack vector eliminated. |

## 17. Incident Response

### Data Breach Impact Assessment

Because Kill the Clipboard does not persistently store PHI:

- **A server breach would NOT expose historical patient records** — there are none on the server
- **A database breach would expose:** organization names, bcrypt password hashes, and encrypted OAuth refresh tokens
- **Impact of database-only breach:** Limited. OAuth tokens are encrypted with per-organization AES-256-GCM keys derived from `HMAC-SHA256(SESSION_SECRET, orgId)`. An attacker with database access alone cannot use the encrypted tokens without also compromising the `SESSION_SECRET` environment variable.
- **Impact of full server compromise (database + SESSION_SECRET):** Attacker could decrypt OAuth tokens and upload files to connected cloud storage or send email from connected accounts until tokens are revoked
- **Mitigation:** Organizations can immediately disconnect services (revoking tokens) and change passwords from the admin page

### Recommended Organization-Level Response Procedures

1. Change admin and staff passwords immediately
2. Disconnect and reconnect all third-party service integrations (this rotates OAuth tokens)
3. Review recent files in connected cloud storage for unauthorized uploads
4. Review sent email in connected Gmail/Outlook accounts for unauthorized messages
5. Notify affected staff to clear browser sessions

## 18. Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Does Kill the Clipboard store patient health records?**
A: No. Health data is decrypted and processed entirely in the user's browser — it never touches the server in its decrypted form during the cryptographic processing phase. The server receives decrypted data only for the purpose of routing it to the organization's configured storage destination, and does not persist it. No health records are written to disk, stored in a database, or cached.

**Q: What data IS stored on the server?**
A: Only organization configuration: organization name, URL slug, bcrypt-hashed passwords, storage destination settings, and OAuth refresh tokens (encrypted at rest with per-organization AES-256-GCM keys). No patient health data is ever stored.

**Q: Is health data encrypted?**
A: Yes, at every stage. SMART Health Links use AES-256-GCM encryption. Data remains encrypted from the SHL server through the CORS proxy all the way to the browser. Decryption only happens in the browser — the decryption key never leaves the browser. All network connections use HTTPS/TLS.

**Q: Does the server ever see decrypted health data?**
A: The server's CORS proxy only handles encrypted JWE payloads and never has the decryption key. After the browser decrypts the data, it sends it to the server's routing endpoint for delivery to the configured storage destination (Drive, email, etc.). The routing endpoint processes this data transiently and does not persist it. This architecture means the server never performs cryptographic operations on health data — that responsibility lies entirely with the browser.

**Q: Can one organization access another organization's data?**
A: No. Every API request is validated against the authenticated organization's slug. Tokens are scoped to a specific organization, and the middleware rejects any cross-tenant access attempts.

**Q: Does Kill the Clipboard need a BAA?**
A: Kill the Clipboard's transient processing model (no PHI storage) limits the scope of BAA requirements. However, organizations should ensure they have appropriate BAAs with their cloud storage and email providers (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Box) since that is where health data is ultimately delivered and stored.

**Q: What happens if the server goes down during a scan?**
A: The scan operation fails and the health data in memory is released. No partial data is stored. The user can simply scan the QR code again once the service is restored.

**Q: Can Kill the Clipboard read our existing emails or cloud files?**
A: No. Gmail and Outlook integrations use send-only permissions. Google Drive uses `drive.file` scope which limits access to files created by the application only. The service cannot read, search, modify, or delete any existing data in connected accounts.

**Q: Where is the infrastructure located?**
A: The application runs on Fly.io in the `iad` region (Ashburn, Virginia, United States).

**Q: What authentication does the scanner page use?**
A: A staff password specific to each organization. Sessions are time-limited (configurable from 1 to 24 hours) and use HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens with server-side expiration enforcement.

**Q: Is the source code available for review?**
A: Yes. The project is open source and available at [github.com/Amy-at-CMS/killtheclipboard](https://github.com/Amy-at-CMS/killtheclipboard).
